## How it works

It is a very basic design where almost all wires are directly connected to the LED, so turning on switches 3-8 will result in the corresponding LED part to light up. 1 and 2 are also connected with LEDs, however there is an XOR gate in between and the output is connected with OUT1. OUT0 always stays dark.

## How to test

Playing around with switches 1 and 2 helps demonstrate the function of an XOR gate. 

## External hardware

Only the already provided LED display was used.
